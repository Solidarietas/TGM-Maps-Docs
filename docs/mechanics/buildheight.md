# Build Height

This module is used to configure the build height limit for the map. Players will not be able to place blocks above this y-level.\
The ability to configure the maximum height at which players can stack boats may be added to this module soon.

## Example

Make the void kill all players who fall below y=-64

```json
	"buildHeight": -64
```
