# Void

This module is used to configure the void. Currently you can only configure at what height the void will kill players.\
The ability to disable instant void kills, and deal custom amounts of damage to players at custom intervals in the void
may be available soon.

## Example

Make the void kill all players who fall below y=-64

```json
	"voidKillHeight": -64
```
